# WinForms PivotGrid Getting Started
The [PivotGridControl]( https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/pivot-grid) is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control that simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The pivot grid, as the name implies, pivots data to be organized in a cross-tabulated form. The major advantage of pivot grid is that you can extract the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, the pivot grid also enables you to summarize and group the data.
